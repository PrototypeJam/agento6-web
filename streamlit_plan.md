# Original Request

I have shared a repo with you so you can see a basic design that I have for a multi-agent system that is highly modular.  The outputs of one module become the inputs for another module.  I want to run this code as a streamlit app, with each module (each .py file) getting it's own page (which we can navigate via tabs or in any other way you think fit).  When the user first enters their API keys, then they can go to the first module and input their goal.  Then the first module will output standard JSON which the user should a) see on the screen and b) be able to download, and c) be able to "Send This Content to Next Module" which will pass the output of the current module to the next module to run and on the tab of that next module the user can see the JSON, download the json, and can select "Send This Content to Next Module".  This repeats until the final module, which creates Markdown instead of JSON and on that page the user should see the markdown and be able to download the markdown.  I also want the user to be able to download the logs for each module if possible.  

## Further Clarifications to Original Request

1. **API Key Storage**: Should we store API keys in session state only (lost on refresh) or provide an option to save them locally/encrypted for convenience?

>> Provide the option to save them locally/encrypted for convenience

2. **Module Dependencies**: I notice modules 2-5 depend on the output of previous modules. Should we:
   - Allow users to upload JSON from previous runs to any module?
   - Enforce sequential execution (module 2 can only run after module 1 completes)?
   - Both options?

>> Both options

3. **Progress Tracking**: Since these modules can take time to run, should we add:
   - Progress indicators for each module?
   - Ability to cancel a running module?
   - Save partial progress?

>> Progress indicators for each module and see below for showing logs as they emerge

4. **Error Handling**: How should we handle module failures?
   - Allow retry with same input?
   - Show detailed error messages?
   - Allow editing of input JSON before retry?

> Allow retry with same input
> Show detailed error messages and see below for lshowing logs which should include all errors
> Allow editing of input JSON before retry is very important.  ALSO allow edit of JSON before user sends to next module.  Always allow editing of input JSON before send to next module and also before retry.

5. **Logs Display**: The current logging setup creates both standard and verbose logs. Should we:
   - Show both in the UI with a toggle?
   - Default to standard logs with verbose as download-only?
   - Add real-time log streaming while modules run?

> Show both standard and verbose logs in the UI with a toggle
> Add real-time log streaming while modules run
> Be sure to allow download of standard and verbose logs

### Suggested Enhancements:

1. **Dashboard/Overview Page**: A home page showing:
   - Current pipeline status
   - Which modules have been completed
   - Quick navigation to any module
> Yes to all

2. **JSON Editor**: Instead of just displaying JSON, provide an editor where users can modify the JSON before sending to the next module (useful for tweaking results)

> Absolutely yes

3. **Pipeline Presets**: Save and load entire pipeline configurations for different use cases

> Yes, make this an option.  Be very clear on UI about what this options does so it is clear that the user does not need to hit next, next but also the user will not be able to tweak JSON between modules so the user is aware of the differences with this option.

4. **Visualization**: For module 3's evaluation results and module 4's revision suggestions, we could add visual representations (charts/graphs)

> No, maybe later.  Add this to README as a future todo item.

5. **Batch Processing**: Allow users to run multiple goals through the pipeline

> No, maybe later.  Add this to README as a future todo item.

Please proceed with a detailed plan incorporating all of the features I agree to above.  After the detailed plan is agreed, we will start by implementing a minimal version.

st.session_state.setdefault('module_outputs', {})
st.session_state.setdefault('module_status', {})
st.session_state.setdefault('current_logs', {})
st.session_state.setdefault('pipeline_config', {})
```

### JSON Editor Component

- Add JSON validation before allowing submission
- Include prettify/minify buttons
- Show validation errors inline

### Log Streaming
- Capture logs using custom log handlers
- Stream to UI using `st.empty()` containers
- Store in session state for later download
- Separate standard and verbose log streams

### Progress Tracking
- Use `st.progress()` for visual indicators
- Update based on log parsing or custom callbacks
