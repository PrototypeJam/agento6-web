## Integrating Perplexity and Anthropic APIs as GPT-4 Alternatives

Migrating a Python application from OpenAI’s GPT-4 to **Perplexity Sonar** and **Anthropic Claude** APIs requires understanding each provider’s documentation, capabilities, and best practices. This guide compiles official information and actionable tips to ensure a seamless integration of Perplexity and Anthropic models as direct replacements for GPT-4.

## Credible and Current API Documentation

**Perplexity API Documentation:** Perplexity AI offers an **official API (Sonar)** with documentation on usage, models, and examples. The Perplexity API is designed to be **compatible with OpenAI’s client libraries**, meaning you can often reuse OpenAI API code by pointing it to Perplexity’s endpoints ([Initial Setup - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started#:~:text=,easy%20integration%20with%20existing%20applications)). The docs include a quickstart and API reference for chat completions, showing how to format requests and use their models. For example, the Perplexity chat completion endpoint is `https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions` and expects a JSON payload similar to OpenAI’s, including a model name and a list of messages with roles (system/user/assistant) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=,)). This close alignment with OpenAI’s API ensures that the information here is up-to-date and easy to apply.

**Anthropic API Documentation:** Anthropic provides **Claude** models via a dedicated API and official docs (including an API console and SDK guides). Claude 3.7 “Sonnet” is Anthropic’s latest flagship model (released Feb 2025) ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20announcing%20Claude%203,the%20model%20can%20think%20for)), available through the Anthropic API. According to Anthropic’s announcements and documentation, Claude 3.7 is accessible for developers via their API (with appropriate API keys) on a usage-based pricing model ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet#:~:text=Pricing%20for%20Claude%203,check%20out%20our%20pricing%20page)). The official docs cover both a classic completion interface and a newer **Messages API** for chat-style interactions. They detail how to format requests (using message roles or a prompt), required parameters, and model IDs. We will specifically use **Claude 3.7 Sonnet (model ID `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)** as our Anthropic model, reflecting the latest version as documented ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Anthropic's Hybrid Reasoning AI Model - Medium](https://medium.com/ai-agent-insider/claude-3-7-sonnet-anthropics-hybrid-reasoning-ai-model-4f859f10eb6b#:~:text=Medium%20medium,the%20length%20of%20Claude%27s%20response)). All information here is drawn from Anthropic’s updated 2025 documentation and reputable sources to ensure accuracy with current models.

Both Perplexity and Anthropic maintain their own **API reference sites** and changelogs. It’s recommended to consult: 

- **Perplexity’s Docs**: [docs.perplexity.ai](https://docs.perplexity.ai) for guides, API reference, pricing, and FAQs.  
- **Anthropic’s Docs**: [docs.anthropic.com](https://docs.anthropic.com) for Claude API usage, model versions, and developer guides.  

These official resources are the baseline for the integration steps and best practices described below.

## Error Handling Best Practices

Integrating third-party LLM APIs requires robust error handling to ensure your application remains stable under various failure conditions. Both Perplexity and Anthropic APIs can encounter issues like network timeouts, rate limits, or invalid requests, and the strategies below will help handle them gracefully:

- **API Response Codes:** Check HTTP status codes on each API response. A `400 Bad Request` indicates something is wrong with your request (e.g. missing or too-large parameters) and should be fixed rather than retried. A `401 Unauthorized` means your API key or auth header is incorrect. For Perplexity, common error codes include 400, 401, `429 Too Many Requests` (rate limit exceeded), and `5xx` server errors ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=200)). Anthropic similarly returns `429` for rate limit issues and uses `500` or `529` for server-side errors (with 529 indicating the service is temporarily overloaded) ([llms-full.txt - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/llms-full.txt#:~:text=llms,API%20is%20temporarily%20overloaded)). 

- **Rate Limit Handling (429 errors):** Both APIs enforce rate limits and will return HTTP 429 if you exceed them. **Perplexity** has request-per-minute limits by model and tier (e.g. 50 RPM for most Sonar models at standard tiers) ([Rate Limits and Usage Tiers - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers#:~:text=Model%20Requests%20per%20minute%20,1776%20%6050)). **Anthropic** imposes limits on requests per minute and tokens per minute/day based on your account’s usage tier ([Our approach to API rate limits | Anthropic Help Center](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8243635-our-approach-to-api-rate-limits#:~:text=Your%20rate%20limit%20depends%20on,has%20hit%20a%20rate%20limit)). When a 429 occurs, inspect the response message – Anthropic’s error will explicitly state a `rate_limit_error` and may include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before retrying ([Rate limits - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#:~:text=Rate%20limits%20,indicating%20how%20long%20to)). The best practice is to implement an **exponential backoff**: pause (e.g. 1 second, then 2, 4, …) and retry the request after the suggested wait or a reasonable delay. Limit the number of retries to avoid infinite loops. If rate limits are consistently hit, consider upgrading your usage tier or reducing request frequency.

- **Server Errors and Overloads:** If you receive a `500 Internal Server Error` or Anthropic’s `529 overloaded_error` (meaning the service is temporarily over capacity) ([llms-full.txt - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/llms-full.txt#:~:text=llms,API%20is%20temporarily%20overloaded)), these are usually transient. Implement retry logic for such cases as well – for instance, retry a few times with delays. The **Anthropic Python SDK** automatically retries certain errors (connection errors, timeouts, 429, and >=500 status codes) up to 2 times with a short backoff by default ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=Certain%20errors%20are%20automatically%20retried,are%20all%20retried%20by%20default)). If not using the SDK, you should manually catch these conditions. For Perplexity, a `504` or `524` timeout error suggests the request took too long (possibly due to complex queries); such requests might be worth retrying or splitting into smaller tasks.

- **Incorrect API Calls (400 errors):** Catch exceptions for invalid requests. For example, if you pass a wrong model name or exceed the model’s context length, the API will return 400. Use meaningful exception messages to log or display what went wrong. In Python, the official libraries raise specific exceptions (e.g., `openai.error.InvalidRequestError` for OpenAI-compatible errors, or `anthropic.BadRequestError` for a 400 response ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=Status%20Code%20Error%20Type%20400,BadRequestError))). Handle these by adjusting your request parameters (such as reducing `max_tokens` or correcting parameter names) rather than retrying.

- **Time-outs and Network Issues:** Wrap API calls in try/except blocks to handle network timeouts or connectivity problems. The Anthropic SDK will raise an `APIConnectionError` if it cannot reach the API ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=When%20the%20library%20is%20unable,anthropic.APIConnectionError)). You can attempt a few quick retries on transient network errors, but if the issue persists, surface an error message in your app (and possibly fall back to a different service if available). It’s also wise to implement a global timeout for requests – for example, do not wait indefinitely for a response. Both APIs support **streaming** responses, which can mitigate long waits (more on streaming below).

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Log error details (status codes, error messages) for debugging. This is especially important during the migration phase to catch any integration issues. Monitor your usage relative to limits; Anthropic’s console and Perplexity’s dashboard can show your current quota usage to help tune your application’s request rate.

By implementing these practices – checking status codes, using retries with backoff, handling exceptions by type, and monitoring usage – you can build a resilient integration. In summary, **back off on 429 (rate limit) errors ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=except%20anthropic.RateLimitError%20as%20e%3A%20print%28,range%20status%20code%20was%20received)), retry a few times on 5xx/overload errors, and fail fast (with logging) on 400-level errors** that require code changes or different input.

## Supported Models and Usage

Both Perplexity and Anthropic offer multiple models. Knowing the available models and their capabilities will help you choose the right one to replace GPT-4 for your use case. Below, we list **Perplexity’s Sonar models** and describe how to use each, followed by details on **Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet** model integration.

### Perplexity Sonar Models

Perplexity’s API provides a family of **Sonar** models, each with different strengths. All are accessed via the same `/chat/completions` endpoint – you specify the model by name in the request. The currently available models and their key characteristics (as of 2025) are:

- **`sonar-deep-research`** – 128k context. A comprehensive research agent that performs extensive web searches and synthesizes the results into detailed reports ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=%60sonar)). This model is ideal when you need an in-depth answer with cited sources. *Integration:* Use this model for tasks that require **extensive knowledge and citations**; simply set `"model": "sonar-deep-research"` in your API call. Keep in mind it may be slower and limited to 5 requests/min at lower tiers due to its heavy work ([Rate Limits and Usage Tiers - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers#:~:text=Model%20Requests%20per%20minute%20,1776%20%6050)).

- **`sonar-reasoning-pro`** – 128k context. A premium reasoning model (powered by the DeepSeek R1 engine) that provides **chain-of-thought (CoT)** reasoning in its responses ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=%60sonar)). It excels at complex problem solving and will include its reasoning steps as part of the answer. *Integration:* Set `"model": "sonar-reasoning-pro"`. Note that this model, like sonar-pro, has a maximum of 8k tokens for each output ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=1.%20%60sonar,not%20use%20our%20search%20subsystem)), so you should cap `max_tokens` accordingly.

- **`sonar-reasoning`** – 128k context. A standard version of the reasoning model with CoT outputs. It is slightly less powerful than the “pro” version but still provides step-by-step reasoning. *Integration:* Use `"model": "sonar-reasoning"` for scenarios requiring reasoning but where the Pro model’s cost or rate limits are a concern. It also outputs chain-of-thought explanations in answers ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=1.%20%60sonar,not%20use%20our%20search%20subsystem)). 

- **`sonar-pro`** – 200k context. The premier **search-grounded** model, supporting advanced queries and follow-up questions ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=%60sonar)). It provides high-quality answers with relevant web citations. *Integration:* Use `"model": "sonar-pro"`. This model has the largest context window (up to 200k tokens) for very long conversations or documents ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=Model%20Context%20Length%20Model%20Type,1776%20%60128k%20Chat%20Completion)). However, its single-response output is limited to 8k tokens max ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=1.%20%60sonar,not%20use%20our%20search%20subsystem)). It’s well-suited for replacing GPT-4 in most applications given its strong performance and breadth of knowledge.

- **`sonar`** – 128k context. A lightweight, faster, and more cost-efficient search-grounded model ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=)). It answers using web information but with fewer searches and a smaller response, making it quicker and cheaper than Sonar Pro. *Integration:* Use `"model": "sonar"` for simpler queries or when you need lower latency and cost. This model works for basic Q&A or summarization with grounding, albeit with less depth than sonar-pro.

- **`r1-1776`** – 128k context. An **offline** chat model (no web search) derived from the DeepSeek R1 model, fine-tuned to provide uncensored, unbiased, factual information ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=%60r1)). It doesn’t retrieve online data, so its answers come from its training knowledge only (no citations or up-to-the-minute info). *Integration:* Use `"model": "r1-1776"` for applications that require no external calls (data privacy) or a consistent personality unaffected by live web content ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=1.%20%60sonar,not%20use%20our%20search%20subsystem)). Features like image search or related question suggestions are not available with this model (since it doesn’t use the search subsystem).

All Perplexity models are used via the same API pattern. For example, using the Python `openai` client, you can integrate **any Sonar model** like so:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY"
openai.api_base = "https://api.perplexity.ai"  # Point OpenAI client to Perplexity
message_history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many stars are there in the Milky Way galaxy?"}
]
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="sonar-pro",           # choose any model: e.g., "sonar-pro"
    messages=message_history,
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.2,
    top_p=0.9
)
answer = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
print(answer)
```

In this example, we set the `api_base` to Perplexity’s endpoint and call the chat completion just as we would for OpenAI. The **model name** is the only change needed (along with the Perplexity API key). The response structure from Perplexity is almost identical to OpenAI’s, with an `id`, `choices` list, `message` content, etc. Additionally, Perplexity’s response may include a `citations` field listing source URLs it used ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=%22id%22%3A%20%223c90c3cc,way.html)) – you can utilize these to display references. 

**Note on Usage Limits:** When integrating, consider the rate limits. For instance, sonar-pro and reasoning-pro allow ~50 requests/min (depending on tier) ([Rate Limits and Usage Tiers - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers#:~:text=Model%20Requests%20per%20minute%20,1776%20%6050)), whereas sonar-deep-research is much lower by default (5 RPM) due to its heavy workload. If your app makes rapid sequential calls, you may need to queue requests or upgrade your tier to avoid hitting 429 errors.

### Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)

Anthropic’s **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** is a state-of-the-art large language model, making it a strong alternative to GPT-4. This model is notable for its **“hybrid reasoning”** ability – it can produce very fast responses or engage in extended step-by-step reasoning (a feature Anthropic calls *extended thinking*) depending on your needs ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20announcing%20Claude%203,the%20model%20can%20think%20for)). Claude 3.7 supports an extremely large context window and very long outputs (up to **128K tokens in extended mode**) ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet#:~:text=Claude%203,rich%20code%20generation%20and%20planning)), which is over 15× longer than previous Claude models. 

**Supported Anthropic Models:** While we focus on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic offers other models like Claude 3.5, Claude Instant, etc. Claude 3.7 is the latest and most capable model for complex tasks. Model IDs in Anthropic’s API are versioned by date – e.g. `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` refers to the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model version released on 2025-02-19 ([Use Anthropic's Claude models | Generative AI - Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude#:~:text=Cloud%20cloud,haiku%4020241022%20%29%20to)). Anthropic often provides an alias like `"claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"` that points to the newest version, but using the full ID ensures you’re targeting the intended version.

**Integration Steps for Claude 3.7:** 

1. **Authentication:** Obtain an API key from Anthropic (via their developer console). Set this key in your environment or code. The Anthropic Python SDK will look for an environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=While%20you%20can%20provide%20an,not%20stored%20in%20source%20control)).

2. **API Call Structure:** Anthropic’s chat API uses a **messages** format similar to OpenAI’s, but with a few differences:
   - You provide a list of messages, each with a `role` and `content`. Allowed roles are `"user"` (for user prompts) and `"assistant"` (for model replies). Unlike OpenAI, there is **no `"system"` role in the messages list** ([Getting Started with Claude API: Everything You Need to Know - Kolena](https://www.kolena.com/guides/getting-started-with-claude-api-everything-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=Note%3A%20To%20include%20a%20system,messages%20in%20the%20Messages%20API)). If you have system-level instructions, you pass them separately via a top-level `system` parameter in the API call.
   - The request JSON includes the `model` name (e.g., `"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"`), `messages`, and generation parameters like `max_tokens` (which Anthropic often calls `max_tokens_to_sample` in older docs) and `temperature`.

3. **Example API Call:** Using the **Anthropic Python SDK** (`anthropic` package), a basic call looks like:

   ```python
   import anthropic

   client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
   response = client.messages.create(
       model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
       system="You are a concise, factual assistant.",  # system-level instruction
       messages=[ {"role": "user", "content": "Hello Claude, how are you?"} ],
       max_tokens=1000,
       temperature=0.7,
       top_p=1  # Anthropic recommends tuning either temperature or top_p, not both ([Create a Text Completion - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/complete#:~:text=,need%20to%20use%20temperature))
   )
   assistant_reply = response.content  # The assistant's answer text
   print(assistant_reply)
   ```
   
   In this snippet, we instantiate the Anthropic client with our API key. We specify the model exactly by ID. We include a `system` prompt (which sets the overall behavior of Claude) outside the messages list ([Getting Started with Claude API: Everything You Need to Know - Kolena](https://www.kolena.com/guides/getting-started-with-claude-api-everything-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=Note%3A%20To%20include%20a%20system,messages%20in%20the%20Messages%20API)), and then a user message. The SDK returns an object (`response`) whose `.content` property contains Claude’s reply. This high-level SDK call corresponds to an HTTP POST to Anthropic’s `/v1/complete` or `/v1/messages` endpoint with a JSON body like:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
     "system": "You are a concise, factual assistant.",
     "messages": [
       {"role": "user", "content": "Hello Claude, how are you?"}
     ],
     "max_tokens": 1000,
     "temperature": 0.7,
     "top_p": 1
   }
   ```
   Anthropic’s response will include the assistant’s message (and metadata like stop reason, token counts, etc.).

4. **Model Capabilities:** Claude 3.7 excels at complex tasks requiring reasoning, coding, and processing large contexts. It can be instructed to perform step-by-step reasoning by enabling *extended thinking* (via an API parameter `{"thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}}` if you want Claude to use up to N tokens to "think" before answering ([Building with extended thinking - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#:~:text=Building%20with%20extended%20thinking%20,)), though this is optional and advanced). By default, Claude will answer quickly for normal prompts. If you supply a long document or conversation (tens of thousands of tokens), Claude can handle it thanks to the 128k context window. Ensure you adjust the `max_tokens` parameter to allow a sufficiently long completion (Anthropic might require setting a high limit explicitly for very long answers).

5. **Rate Limits and Usage:** Anthropic’s API usage is **metered by tokens**. Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s pricing is **$3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens** ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet#:~:text=Pricing%20for%20Claude%203,check%20out%20our%20pricing%20page)). There may also be throughput limits (e.g., tokens per minute). If you hit a rate limit, the API returns a 429 with an error message. You might rarely encounter the model’s upper context limit, but if you do, the API will return an error indicating too many tokens – in such cases, shorten the conversation or context.

6. **Streaming:** For real-time applications, Anthropic supports streaming responses (SSE). In the SDK, you would use a streaming method (e.g., iterate over `client.messages.create(..., stream=True)`). This allows you to start processing Claude’s answer token-by-token. Use streaming for better latency, especially with long outputs.

With this integration, you have effectively replaced OpenAI’s GPT-4 calls with Anthropic’s Claude. The *Claude 3.7 Sonnet* model should be able to handle similar tasks with high quality. It’s recommended to test Claude’s responses against your use cases (it may have slightly different style or formatting than GPT-4, and the absence of a system role in messages means you should use the `system` param to set context or persona).

## Complete API Documentation for Developers

In this section, we provide a consolidated reference for using the Perplexity and Anthropic APIs in your Python code. We cover authentication, request/response formats, key parameters, as well as notes on rate limits, pricing, and performance. This will serve as a **developer-ready cheat sheet** for integration.

### Authentication and Environment Setup

**Perplexity (Sonar API):** After signing up and adding a payment method (if required) on Perplexity’s platform, generate an API key from the **API Settings** page ([Initial Setup - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started#:~:text=Registration)) ([Initial Setup - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started#:~:text=Generate%20an%20API%20key)). This key is a long-lived token used to authenticate your requests. In every API call, include the key in the HTTP Authorization header as a Bearer token:  
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
``` 
If using the OpenAI Python client, you can simply set `openai.api_key` to this key (the library will then include it in requests). No separate organization ID is needed for Perplexity.

**Anthropic (Claude API):** Sign up for an Anthropic account and retrieve your API key from the Anthropic **Console** (under API keys). Anthropic’s Python SDK reads the key from the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=While%20you%20can%20provide%20an,not%20stored%20in%20source%20control)). So, you can either export this variable in your shell or use a library like `python-dotenv` to load it. Alternatively, when initializing the client in code, pass `api_key="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"` explicitly. Anthropic’s API expects the key in an HTTP header (when calling directly, use `x-api-key: YOURKEY`), but the SDK handles this internally.

**Environment Setup:** Install the necessary Python packages:
- For Perplexity integration, install the OpenAI Python package (if not already installed): `pip install openai`. Use version 1.0+ which supports the `OpenAI` client class and custom endpoints.
- For Anthropic, install the official SDK: `pip install anthropic` ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=,install%20anthropic)). This provides the `anthropic.Anthropic` client used in our examples. 

It’s good practice to keep your API keys out of source code. Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager. In development, you can store keys in a `.env` file and load them, as recommended by Anthropic ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=While%20you%20can%20provide%20an,not%20stored%20in%20source%20control)).

### API Call Structure and Examples

Both APIs use JSON-based requests over HTTPS. Here’s what the request and response structures look like:

**Perplexity Chat Completions (OpenAI-compatible):** You make a POST request to `https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions` with a JSON body containing the model and message history. For example (in raw JSON):

```json
{
  "model": "sonar", 
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many stars are there in our galaxy?"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 123,
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "top_p": 0.9,
  "stream": false
}
``` 

This format mirrors OpenAI’s ChatCompletion request ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=,)) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=,false)). The response from Perplexity will include an `id`, the `model` name, and a list of `choices`. Each choice contains an `assistant` message with the generated content, and possibly a `finish_reason` (e.g. “stop” if it ended naturally) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=,Milky%20Way%20galaxy%20is%20estimated)). Perplexity-specific fields in the response include:
- **`citations`**: an array of URLs of sources the model consulted ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=%22citations%22%3A%20%5B%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astronomy.com%2Fscience%2Fastro,there.html%22%2C%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMilky_Way%22)) (for models that use web search). You can display or utilize these as references.
- **`related_questions`** (if `return_related_questions` was true): suggested follow-up questions.
- **`images`** (if any, and if `return_images` was enabled): image results.

When using the OpenAI Python client, the call `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` returns a Python dict with the same structure. For example, `response['choices'][0]['message']['content']` gives the assistant’s text answer.

**Anthropic Messages API:** If calling via HTTP, you would POST to Anthropic’s endpoint (e.g. `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete` for the completion API, or a similar endpoint for the new messages interface) with JSON like:

```json
{
  "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
  "system": "You are a helpful assistant.",  // system instruction (optional)
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude!"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 1000,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "stop_sequences": ["\n\nHuman:"]
}
```

Anthropic’s response will typically look like:

```json
{
  "completion": "Hi there! I’m Claude, an AI assistant. How can I help you today?",
  "stop_reason": "stop_sequence",
  "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
  "tokens_consumed": {
    "input": 5,
    "output": 14
  }
}
```

If using the Anthropic SDK, the `client.messages.create()` returns an object (or dataclass) where `response.content` contains the `completion` text (the assistant’s latest reply). The SDK might abstract away `stop_reason` and token counts, but they are available in the lower-level response if needed.

**Notable Differences:** Unlike OpenAI’s chat format which intermixes roles in one list (system/user/assistant), Anthropic’s design encourages separating system instructions. The **lack of a system role** in the messages array means you should supply any system prompt via the `system` field ([Getting Started with Claude API: Everything You Need to Know - Kolena](https://www.kolena.com/guides/getting-started-with-claude-api-everything-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=Note%3A%20To%20include%20a%20system,messages%20in%20the%20Messages%20API)). If you do not need a system prompt, you can omit that field. Also, Anthropic uses specific stop sequences under the hood (e.g., the string `"\n\nHuman:"` often denotes the end of the assistant’s answer in the prompt format). In the messages API, you typically don’t need to set `stop_sequences` manually unless you have a reason – by default the API will stop at the end of the assistant’s turn.

Both APIs support **streaming** responses. For Perplexity with the OpenAI client, set `stream=True` in the request and iterate over the resulting generator (each chunk will contain a portion of the `content`). For Anthropic’s SDK, you can similarly request streaming (the client will yield events). The streaming responses are event-stream data where each event contains a new partial completion. This is useful for giving the end-user immediate feedback while the model is still generating a long answer.

### Key Parameters and Tuning (Temperature, Top-p, etc.)

To control the behavior of the models, you can adjust various parameters in the API calls. Here are the key parameters supported by Perplexity (largely matching OpenAI’s) and Anthropic, with their usage:

- **`max_tokens`**: *Maximum tokens to generate in the response.* For both APIs, this limits the length of the output. The prompt length + `max_tokens` must not exceed the model’s context limit (e.g., 128k for most Sonar models ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=The%20maximum%20number%20of%20completion,end%20of%20its%20context%20window)), 200k for sonar-pro, or up to 128k output for Claude 3.7). If `max_tokens` is omitted, Perplexity will default to the model’s maximum or stop at a natural stopping point. Anthropic requires this (or uses a default) to know how much to generate; e.g., if you expect a brief answer, you might put 300, but for Claude’s long outputs you might put 10,000. Monitor usage since output tokens count toward billing.

- **`temperature`**: *Controls randomness in generation.* Both APIs use 0 to 2 range for this parameter. A low temperature (e.g. 0 or 0.2) makes the output more deterministic and focused (good for factual answers), while higher values (e.g. 0.7 or 1.0) produce more creative or diverse responses. Perplexity’s default temperature is 0.2 ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=temperature)) (fairly low, prioritizing precision) whereas Anthropic’s default is around 1.0 for a balanced creativity. Adjust this to suit your use case – e.g., for code or math answers you might use temp=0 to reduce errors. 

- **`top_p`**: *Nucleus sampling probability cutoff.* Ranges from 0 to 1. This is an alternative way to control diversity: at each token, the model considers only the most likely tokens whose cumulative probability is at most `top_p`. A lower `top_p` (like 0.5) makes output more focused (limited to top predictions), while `1.0` means no cutoff (consider all). Perplexity defaults to 0.9 ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=top_p)). Anthropic supports `top_p` as well, though they often suggest tweaking only one of `temperature` or `top_p` for advanced use cases ([Create a Text Completion - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/complete#:~:text=,need%20to%20use%20temperature)). If you use `top_p`, perhaps set temperature higher to avoid deterministic output, but typically leaving `top_p=1` (no nucleus filtering) and just using temperature is simplest.

- **`top_k`**: *Top-K sampling cutoff.* This limits the model to considering the top K most likely tokens at each step. Perplexity supports this (0 to 2048, where 0 means disabled) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=top_k)). For example, `top_k=50` means “consider only the 50 most probable tokens for each step”. As with `top_p`, you usually use either `top_k` or `top_p` but not both; Perplexity’s docs explicitly recommend altering one or the other, not both ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=default%3A0)) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=default%3A0)). Anthropic also has a `top_k` parameter (the Anthropic default might be 0 or 5 according to some sources). In most scenarios, you can leave `top_k=0` (disabled) and rely on `temperature`/`top_p`.

- **`presence_penalty`** and **`frequency_penalty`** (Perplexity/OpenAI): These work as in OpenAI’s API. `presence_penalty` (range -2.0 to 2.0) encourages the model to talk about new topics by penalizing or boosting tokens that have appeared already ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=presence_penalty)). `frequency_penalty` (>0 to penalize repetition) reduces likelihood of repeating the same token frequently ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=frequency_penalty)). In Perplexity’s API, the default presence_penalty is 0 and frequency_penalty is 1 (meaning no penalty, since they apply it multiplicatively where 1.0 = neutral) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=A%20value%20between%20,frequency_penalty)) ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=default%3A1)). You typically won’t need to change these unless you notice either excessive repetition (then increase frequency penalty slightly >1) or the model refusing to move to new topics (then try a small presence penalty >0). Anthropic’s API does not expose these exact parameters in the same way; their model behavior is tuned via the prompt. (Anthropic might allow some form of repetition penalty internally, but the official docs don’t list a presence/frequency penalty for Claude.)

- **`stop` or `stop_sequences`**: You can instruct the generation to halt when a certain token or sequence is encountered. In OpenAI/Perplexity, `stop` might be a string or list of strings (e.g., stop at “\nUser:” or similar). In Anthropic, you have `stop_sequences` which serve the same purpose. By default, Anthropic uses `"\n\nHuman:"` and `"\n\nUser:"` as stop sequences to mark when the user is speaking again, ensuring the assistant doesn’t continue beyond its turn. You generally don’t need to set this manually unless you have a custom delimiter in your prompt or want to truncate output at a certain phrase.

- **`stream`**: (boolean) If true, the API will return a stream of partial results. In HTTP, this is done via Server-Sent Events (SSE) where the response has `Content-Type: text/event-stream` ([Chat Completions - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions#:~:text=default%3Afalse)). In the OpenAI Python client, setting `stream=True` allows you to iterate over the response generator, receiving chunks (each chunk in `.choices[0].delta.content` for OpenAI’s format). In Anthropic’s Python SDK, you would likely get an iterable or callback for stream events. Use this parameter for improved latency on long responses, or if you want to show a typing indicator / partial text to users.

- **Anthropic-specific parameters:** Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 introduced the ability to control a “thinking” mode. While not a standard parameter in all calls, you might encounter `{"thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}}` in their docs ([Building with extended thinking - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#:~:text=Building%20with%20extended%20thinking%20,)). This is used to enable extended reasoning – Claude will internally consume up to `budget_tokens` tokens to reason (which you pay for) before producing the final answer, and it will actually return the reasoning steps visible to the user. This is an advanced feature for specific needs (transparency in reasoning). Unless your application benefits from seeing the chain-of-thought, you can leave this off (default is normal mode). 

In summary, **tuning these parameters** allows you to shape the output. For a start, migrating from GPT-4, you might set `temperature=0.7` and `top_p=1` to get reasonably creative but still relevant answers, and adjust `max_tokens` to your needs (keeping in mind Perplexity’s 8k output limit on some models ([Supported Models - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards#:~:text=1.%20%60sonar,not%20use%20our%20search%20subsystem))). Both APIs advise not to tweak too many things at once; often just temperature is sufficient to control randomness ([Create a Text Completion - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/complete#:~:text=,need%20to%20use%20temperature)).

### Rate Limits, Pricing, and Performance Considerations

When replacing GPT-4 with Perplexity and Anthropic, it’s crucial to consider **costs and throughput**, as they may differ from OpenAI’s.

**Perplexity Pricing:** The Sonar API uses a token-based pricing model with some nuance:
- **Input tokens** (your prompt) are billed per million tokens, as are **output tokens** (the model’s completion). The rates vary by model. For example, *Sonar Pro* is $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens ([Pricing - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#:~:text=%60sonar)) – interestingly, very similar to Claude’s pricing. A cheaper model like *sonar* might be $1 per million for both input and output ([Pricing - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#:~:text=Model%20Input%20Tokens%20,8)), reflecting its smaller or less costly model.
- Some models incur additional costs: e.g., *Deep Research* has **search query** charges ($5 per 1000 searches) and **reasoning tokens** (an extra $3 per million tokens for the internal reasoning step it performs) ([Pricing - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#:~:text=Model%20Input%20Tokens%20,8)) ([Pricing - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#:~:text=Reasoning%20Tokens)). These are unique to the more complex agents. For straightforward QA on sonar/sonar-pro, you mainly pay input/output tokens.
- **Example:** If sonar-pro processes a 1000-token question and returns a 1000-token answer, that’s 0.001M * $3 + 0.001M * $15 = $0.018 total cost for that call. Always refer to Perplexity’s pricing page for the latest rates per model ([Pricing - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#:~:text=Pricing)).

**Anthropic Pricing:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s pricing is **$3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens** ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet#:~:text=Pricing%20for%20Claude%203,check%20out%20our%20pricing%20page)) (same structure as above). This is significantly cheaper per token than OpenAI’s GPT-4 (which is about $60 per million for inputs at 8k context), meaning you might reduce costs by switching, especially for large volumes of text. Claude’s 128k context might tempt you to send huge prompts – just be mindful that you pay for all tokens sent and received. If you enable extended thinking, the “thinking tokens” (Claude’s internal reasoning) are counted as output tokens in billing. Anthropic provides ways to reduce cost, like **prompt caching** (not re-billing the same prompt content within some time window) and **batching requests** ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet#:~:text=Pricing%20for%20Claude%203,check%20out%20our%20pricing%20page)), which are advanced optimizations if needed.

**Rate Limits:** We covered earlier that each provider has rate limits:
- *Perplexity:* Tied to your **usage tier**, which depends on cumulative spend ([Rate Limits and Usage Tiers - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers#:~:text=Tier%20Credit%20Purchase%20,5000)). Higher tiers increase your allowed requests per minute and enable certain features. For instance, Tier 0 (free or trial tier) might have very low RPM. In Tier 1+ (paid), most models allow 50 RPM ([Rate Limits and Usage Tiers - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers#:~:text=Model%20Requests%20per%20minute%20,1776%20%6050)), with the exception of heavy models like deep-research (5 RPM initially). Ensure your expected traffic fits within these; if not, contact Perplexity for higher limits or implement a request queue.
- *Anthropic:* Also uses usage-based tiers. The exact default rates might not be publicly detailed, but typically it could be around 100k tokens per minute for input/output and some hundreds of requests per minute at Tier 1, scaling up for higher tiers. You can view your organization’s limits in the Anthropic Console ([Our approach to API rate limits | Anthropic Help Center](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8243635-our-approach-to-api-rate-limits#:~:text=Remember%2C%20rate%20limits%20are%20set,found%20in%20our%20API%20docs)). If you hit the limit, you get a 429 with a message of which limit (requests or tokens) was exceeded. The response will include a `Retry-After` header telling you how many seconds to wait ([Rate limits - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#:~:text=Rate%20limits%20,indicating%20how%20long%20to)). Plan your usage to stay below daily token limits as well (Anthropic might have a cap like 1B tokens/day on lower tiers).

**Throughput and Latency:** Performance-wise, both APIs are comparable to OpenAI’s in speed, with some differences:
- **Perplexity** models that use web search (sonar, sonar-pro, etc.) may have added latency on the first call of a conversation due to performing search queries and reading results. The example Deep Research can take a noticeable few seconds because it’s reading many pages. Subsequent follow-ups might be faster if some context is cached. If you need consistent low-latency responses, consider the *r1-1776* model (no search) or ensure prompts are specific to reduce the need for multiple web lookups.
- **Anthropic Claude 3.7** is optimized for both fast and “thinky” responses. In standard mode, it’s quite fast – often on par with or faster than GPT-4 for moderate lengths. In extended thinking mode (if you explicitly enable it), the model will take longer as it’s effectively doing more computation (but you get a better answer for very complex tasks). Claude’s 100k+ token outputs, if you ever use them, will stream out and could take minutes to complete; for such cases, definitely use the streaming feature to start processing the output as it comes. For typical Q&A or small tasks, expect latency in the few-hundred-milliseconds to a couple seconds range, similar to other LLM APIs.

**Quality and Testing:** After integration, test your application’s outputs with the new models. Claude 3.7 is *highly capable*, often outperforming GPT-4 in coding and reasoning tasks ([Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet#:~:text=how%20long%20the%20model%20can,think%20for)), but it may have different quirks (e.g., it’s tuned to be helpful and might be more verbose unless instructed to be concise). Perplexity’s models will provide sourced answers which can be a bonus for user trust. Ensure the format of outputs (e.g., function call syntax, markdown usage, etc.) meets your needs – minor prompt adjustments might be needed to get identical behavior to GPT-4.

By understanding the documentation, handling errors properly, choosing the right model, and configuring parameters, you can confidently replace GPT-4 with **Perplexity Sonar** and **Anthropic Claude** in your Python application. This provides diversity and resilience in your AI backend while maintaining high-quality outputs.

## Python Package Recommendations

To integrate these APIs in Python, the **official SDKs** are the easiest and most reliable approach:

- **Perplexity via OpenAI SDK:** Perplexity explicitly designed their API to be **OpenAI-compatible** ([Initial Setup - Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started#:~:text=,easy%20integration%20with%20existing%20applications)), so you can use OpenAI’s Python client to call Perplexity’s models. The recommendation is to use the latest `openai` package (version 1.x). This library already handles HTTPS calls, streaming, and error parsing. By setting `openai.api_base = "https://api.perplexity.ai"` and using your Perplexity API key, your existing OpenAI integration code can call Perplexity with minimal changes. This leverages the battle-tested OpenAI client for things like retries and JSON parsing. If you prefer not to use the OpenAI library, you could use Python’s `requests` to POST to the Perplexity endpoint directly, but then you will need to implement your own error handling and streaming support. Given that Perplexity’s goal is easy integration, sticking with the OpenAI SDK is generally best.

- **Anthropic SDK (`anthropic` package):** For Anthropic Claude, the official **anthropic Python SDK** is highly recommended. It’s available on PyPI (`pip install anthropic`) ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=,install%20anthropic)) and provides convenient methods to create completion requests. The SDK includes built-in handling of things like rate limit errors (raising a `anthropic.RateLimitError` you can catch) and even automatically retries certain failures ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=Certain%20errors%20are%20automatically%20retried,are%20all%20retried%20by%20default)), which can save you effort. It supports synchronous and asynchronous usage, and streaming. Under the hood it uses `httpx` for HTTP calls, which is robust and fast. Using the SDK ensures you’re sending requests with the correct format (e.g., it will format messages into the right JSON for the API). While you could call Anthropic’s API with a generic HTTP library, the SDK will reduce mistakes (like forgetting the required headers or mis-formatting the JSON). Therefore, for production use, `anthropic` SDK is the best choice to integrate Claude. 

- **Library Versions:** Make sure you use updated versions of these libraries. OpenAI’s Python library had a significant update in mid-2023 (v1.0) that introduced the `OpenAI` client class and other changes ([v1.0.0 Migration Guide · openai openai-python · Discussion #742](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742#:~:text=v1,client%20must%20be%20used%20instead)). Version 0.xx did not support the `OpenAI(api_key, base_url)` usage, so upgrade if you haven’t (to avoid import errors ([Cannot import name 'OpenAI' from 'openai' - API](https://community.openai.com/t/cannot-import-name-openai-from-openai/486147#:~:text=I%20run%20import%20openai%20import,4))). For the anthropic SDK, keep an eye on its release notes – as new models come out (Claude Instant, Claude 4, etc.), you might need to update to get their IDs and any new parameters. The snippet examples provided here assume current versions where these methods exist.

- **Alternative Libraries:** If your application already uses a higher-level framework like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex**, check if they have integrations for Perplexity or Anthropic. For instance, LangChain supports Anthropic’s API and you can configure it with your key; and Perplexity can be used via generic OpenAI interface in such frameworks by adjusting the endpoint. However, introducing those is beyond the scope of a direct integration guide. Another alternative is **OpenRouter** or other multi-provider APIs, but since you are doing a direct replacement, using the official clients as described is straightforward.

- **Concurrency and Async:** Both official libraries allow async calls (OpenAI’s can be used with `aiohttp` or via setting up an async client, and Anthropic has an `AsyncAnthropic` in its SDK ([GitHub - anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python#:~:text=Async%20usage))). If your app needs to call multiple generations in parallel, consider using these async capabilities or threading to maximize throughput within rate limits.

In conclusion, **use the `openai` package for Perplexity** (reusing OpenAI code with minor tweaks) and **the `anthropic` package for Claude**. These are the officially supported and well-documented tools, ensuring that you have community and vendor support. By following this guide and utilizing the recommended libraries, you can achieve a seamless migration from OpenAI’s GPT-4 to Perplexity’s and Anthropic’s APIs, harnessing their capabilities with confidence and minimal changes to your codebase.

**Survey Note: Comprehensive Guide for Swapping Models**

This note provides a detailed, professional guide for developers to swap out GPT-4o in your existing Python code using the OpenAI API, replacing it with any Perplexity model or Anthropic's "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219". It includes corrections, additions, and current API features, ensuring all necessary information is covered for successful integration as of March 11, 2025\.  
**Background and Context**  
Your current code uses the OpenAI API with GPT-4o, and you aim to integrate Perplexity and Anthropic models. Perplexity's API is designed to be OpenAI client-compatible, while Anthropic requires a different library and message format. This guide addresses corrections needed for compatibility and additions for enhanced functionality, including error handling, rate limits, and all relevant parameters.  
**Corrections for Perplexity**  
Perplexity's API allows use of the openai library by changing the base\_url to https://api.perplexity.ai and using a Perplexity API key. However, based on recent updates, the following corrections are necessary:

* **Model Name Verification**: The example in your guide uses "sonAR-pro", but as of February 22, 2025, several models were deprecated, with recommendations to use Sonar or Sonar Pro models. Check the latest model names at [Perplexity API documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/). For instance, current models might include "llama-3-sonar-large-32k-online" based on recent changes.  
* **Response Parsing**: Ensure responses are parsed correctly. Use print(response.choices\[0\].message.content) to extract the content, as Perplexity's response structure aligns with OpenAI's.  
* **Error Handling**: Add try-except blocks to handle potential API errors, such as invalid API keys or deprecated models.

Example corrected code:  
python

```py
import os
from openai import OpenAI

api_key = os.getenv("PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "INSERT PERPLEXITY API KEY HERE")
base_url = "https://api.perplexity.ai"

client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many stars are in the universe?"}
]

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sonAR-pro",  # Verify this model name
        messages=messages
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Corrections for Anthropic**  
Anthropic's API requires the anthropic library and has a different message format. For "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", the following corrections are needed:

* **Library and Client**: Use the anthropic library, not openai. Initialize with anthropic.Anthropic(api\_key=api\_key).  
* **Message Format**: Separate system prompts from messages. Anthropic expects a system parameter and a messages list with "user" and "assistant" roles, excluding "system".  
* **Model Name**: Confirm "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" is available, as it follows Anthropic's naming convention (e.g., snapshot date February 19, 2025). Check [Anthropic Models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) for updates.  
* **Response Parsing**: Parse responses with print(response.content\[0\].text), as Anthropic returns a Message object with content as a list of text blocks.  
* **Error Handling**: Add try-except blocks for API errors.

Example corrected code:  
python

```py
import os
import anthropic

api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "INSERT ANTHROPIC API KEY HERE")
client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=api_key)

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"}
]

system = next((m["content"] for m in messages if m["role"] == "system"), "")
filtered_messages = [m for m in messages if m["role"] in ["user", "assistant"]]

try:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
        max_tokens=1024,
        system=system,
        messages=filtered_messages
    )
    print(response.content[0].text)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Additions for Enhanced Compatibility**  
To ensure robust integration, consider the following additions:

* **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables (e.g., PERPLEXITY\_API\_KEY, ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY) for security, using os.getenv.  
* **Streaming Support**: Both APIs support streaming for real-time responses. For Perplexity, use stream=True in client.chat.completions.create. For Anthropic, use stream=True in client.messages.create, processing chunks with for chunk in response.  
* **Perplexity Search Features**: Perplexity offers unique parameters like search\_domain\_filter, search\_recency\_filter, and return\_citations. Include these in extra\_body for enhanced search capabilities.  
* **Anthropic Message Conversion**: Create a function to convert OpenAI-style messages to Anthropic format, handling system prompts separately.  
* **Context Window and Parameters**: Adjust max\_tokens based on model capabilities (e.g., Claude models support up to 200k tokens). Include parameters like temperature, top\_p, and top\_k for fine-tuning, as detailed below.

**Current API Features and Parameters**

## Comprehensive Integration Guide: Replacing OpenAI GPT-4o with Perplexity and Anthropic Models

## Introduction

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for developers looking to replace OpenAI's GPT-4o with either Perplexity or Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet models in existing Python code. As of March 2025, both providers offer compelling alternatives with unique capabilities that can be integrated with minimal code changes. This document covers authentication, API usage, model parameters, rate limits, error handling, and all necessary technical details to ensure a smooth transition.

## Perplexity API Integration

Perplexity's API is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI Python SDK, making the transition particularly straightforward. Their current flagship offerings are the Sonar and Sonar Pro models, which include real-time web search capabilities with citations.

### Setup and Authentication

To begin using Perplexity's API, you must first register for an account, add credits to your balance, and generate an API key:

1. Create an account at perplexity.ai
2. Add credits to your balance (required before generating an API key)
3. Navigate to the API section to generate your API key

### Basic API Usage

Since Perplexity designed their API to be compatible with OpenAI's client, you can use the OpenAI Python package with a different base URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize client with Perplexity credentials
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your_perplexity_api_key",  
    base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai"
)

# Create a completion request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-pro",  # Use Perplexity model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest developments in AI?"}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1024
)

# Access the response
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Available Models (as of March 2025)

Perplexity offers two primary models:

1. **Sonar**: Fast, straightforward answers optimized for speed
2. **Sonar Pro**: Handles complex questions requiring deeper research and provides more sources

Previous model names like `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online` and `llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online` have been deprecated as of February 22, 2025[8].

### Request Parameters

Perplexity supports standard OpenAI parameters plus several unique ones:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| model | string | Required. Use "sonar" or "sonar-pro" |
| messages | array | Required. Conversation history in the same format as OpenAI |
| temperature | float | Optional. Controls randomness (0-1, default varies by model) |
| max_tokens | integer | Optional. Maximum tokens to generate |
| top_p | float | Optional. Controls diversity via nucleus sampling |
| search_domain_filter | string | Optional. Filter searches to specific domains |
| return_images | boolean | Optional. Whether to include images in response (default: false) |
| return_related_questions | boolean | Optional. Whether to suggest follow-up questions (default: false) |
| search_recency_filter | string | Optional. Filter search results by recency |
| top_k | integer | Optional. Number of top search results to consider |

### Response Structure

Perplexity responses include standard OpenAI fields with additional citation information:

```json
{
  "id": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
  "model": "sonar-pro",
  "created": 1710148220,
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The response text..."
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 57,
    "completion_tokens": 128,
    "total_tokens": 185
  },
  "citations": [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2"
  ]
}
```

### Rate Limits

Perplexity implements rate limits of 50 requests per minute for all users as of January 2025[2][8]. These limits are enforced at the account level, and exceeding them will result in 429 error responses.

### Error Handling

```python
from openai import OpenAI, OpenAIError

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your_perplexity_api_key",
    base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai"
)

try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sonar-pro",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
except OpenAIError as e:
    if "429" in str(e):
        print(f"Rate limit exceeded: {e}")
        # Implement backoff strategy here
    else:
        print(f"API error: {e}")
```

### Advanced Error Handling with Retry Logic

For production systems, implement exponential backoff with jitter:

```python
import time
import random
from openai import OpenAI, OpenAIError

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your_perplexity_api_key",
    base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai"
)

def make_perplexity_request(max_retries=5):
    retries = 0
    while retries  tuple:
        """Convert OpenAI-style messages to Anthropic format."""
        system_content = None
        anthropic_messages = []
        
        # Extract system message if present
        for msg in messages:
            if msg["role"] == "system":
                system_content = msg["content"]
            else:
                anthropic_messages.append(msg)
        
        # Ensure valid message sequence for Anthropic
        if not anthropic_messages or anthropic_messages[0]["role"] != "user":
            anthropic_messages.insert(0, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"})
        
        return system_content, anthropic_messages
    
    def generate(
        self, 
        messages: List[Dict[str, str]], 
        model: Optional[str] = None,
        max_tokens: int = 1024,
        temperature: float = 0.7,
        stream: bool = False,
        **kwargs

### Usage Example

```python
# Create clients for different providers
openai_client = LLMClient(provider="openai")
perplexity_client = LLMClient(provider="perplexity")
anthropic_client = LLMClient(provider="anthropic")

# Define messages in OpenAI format
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the difference between fusion and fission."}
]

# Generate responses from each provider
openai_response = openai_client.generate(messages)
perplexity_response = perplexity_client.generate(messages)
anthropic_response = anthropic_client.generate(messages)

print("OpenAI response:", openai_response["content"][:100] + "...")
print("Perplexity response:", perplexity_response["content"][:100] + "...")
print("Anthropic response:", anthropic_response["content"][:100] + "...")
```

## Recommendations and Best Practices

### Package Recommendations

1. **Perplexity**: The OpenAI Python SDK is the recommended approach as Perplexity explicitly designed their API to be compatible with it.

2. **Anthropic**: The official `anthropic` Python package is recommended for production use to access all Claude features. While the OpenAI compatibility layer exists, it has limitations and may not support all features.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Streaming**: Both APIs support streaming responses, which is crucial for reducing time-to-first-token in user-facing applications.

2. **Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limit handling with exponential backoff for both APIs.

3. **Token Usage**: Monitor token usage closely, especially for Anthropic where `max_tokens` is strictly enforced.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling as shown in the examples to ensure resilience.

### Unique Features

1. **Perplexity**:
   - Citations in responses for factual queries
   - Domain filtering for targeted search
   - Real-time web search capabilities

2. **Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet**:
   - Extended thinking for complex reasoning tasks
   - Larger context window (up to 128K tokens)
   - More sophisticated system prompt handling

## Conclusion

Transitioning from OpenAI's GPT-4o to either Perplexity or Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet is straightforward with the appropriate client libraries and configuration. Perplexity offers an OpenAI-compatible interface that makes the transition particularly smooth, while Anthropic's dedicated SDK provides access to Claude's unique capabilities.

The wrapper class provided in this guide enables seamless switching between providers with minimal code changes, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of each model as needed. By following the recommendations and best practices outlined here, you can ensure robust, efficient integration of these alternative AI models into your applications.
